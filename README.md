![Image](./readme_img_0.png)

This is an example of a poll that Kraken can make.

## How do I run it?

Make a discord bot at https://discord.com/developers/applications. Copy the token of it and put it in a file called `tokenfile` (this can be done using `xclip -se c -o > tokenfile`). Run the bot by running either `python kraken.py` or `./enableDM.sh`. <!--change to ./startBot.sh if #9 gets pulled-->. When the bot turns on it'll generate an invite link using the latest required permissions integer.

## How do I use it?

Run k!help. It'll tell you everything there is to know about all of the commands.
